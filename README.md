goiuplua-skeleton
=================

A skeleton project for making a GUI for Go with IUP and Lua.

Only tested on Windows 7 x64 with 64bit mingw.

I included https://github.com/stevedonovan/luar and https://github.com/aarzilli/golua in the project so I could add pkg-config.bat to them so this project would compile.
